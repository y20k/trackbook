How to contribute to Trackbook
==============================

### Report a bug or suggest a new feature
Bugs and new features are being discussed on the GitHub [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/y20k/trackbook/issues).
The issue "[Previous discussions and feature requests](https://github.com/y20k/trackbook/issues/57)" lists some of the features that were rejected - either because they did not fit conceptually or because I could not figure out how to implement them.

### Help with translations
The translations are managed on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/trackbook/strings/).
Help is much appreciated.

### Submit your own solutions
Help is very welcome, be it in the form of code, artwork, enhancements to the website, tutorial videos, or whatever.
**But please** suggest new features or enhancements in advance on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/y20k/trackbook/issues) before implementing them.
